# Understand Terraform Basics

## Handling Terraform and provider installation and versioning

### Installing Terraform on different OS'
Mac: *brew install terraform*

Windows: *choco install terraform*

Manually: First download the zip file then *mv ~/Downloads/terraform /usr/local/bin/terraform

### Configuring Terraform
We use a terraform configuration block type to configure behaviors of Terraform itself, such a srequiring a minimum version of Terraform to apply the configuration. Ex: 

```
terraform {
    # ...
}
```

### What is a "provider"?
A provider is a logical abstraction of an upstream API. They are responsible for understanding API interactions and exposing resources. Examples are public clod services such as AWS, GCP, or Azure, or a PaaS service as Heroku, a SaaS service as DNSimple or CloudFare, or on-orem resources such as vSphere. All providers integrate into and operate with Terraform exactly the same way. Because Terraform can interact with any API, you can respresent almost any infrasructure type as a resource in Terraform.
