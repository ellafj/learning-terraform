# Understand Terraform Basics

## Handling Terraform and provider installation and versioning

### Installing Terraform on different OS'
Mac: *brew install terraform*

Windows: *choco install terraform*

Manually: First download the zip file then *mv ~/Downloads/terraform /usr/local/bin/terraform*

### Configuring Terraform
We use a terraform configuration block type to configure behaviors of Terraform itself, such a srequiring a minimum version of Terraform to apply the configuration. Ex: 

```
terraform {
    # ...
}
```

NB! Only constants are allowed inside the terraform block! Arguments may not refer to names objects such as resources, input variables, etc, and may not use any of the Terraform language built-in functions. 

### What is a "provider"?
A provider is a logical abstraction of an upstream API. They are responsible for understanding API interactions and exposing resources. Examples are public clod services such as AWS, GCP, or Azure, or a PaaS service as Heroku, a SaaS service as DNSimple or CloudFare, or on-orem resources such as vSphere. All providers integrate into and operate with Terraform exactly the same way. Because Terraform can interact with any API, you can respresent almost any infrasructure type as a resource in Terraform. 

### Provider configuration
The name given in the block header is the name of the provider to configure ("google" in the example below). Terraform associates each resource type with a provider by taking the first word of the resource type name separated by underscores, and so the "google" provider is assumed to be the provider for the resource group name *google_compute_instance_*.

The body of the block contains configuration arguments for the provider itself. Most arguments in this sections are specified by the provider itself. In this example, both proect and region are specific to the google provider. 

```
provider "google" {
    project = "acme-app"
    region = "us-central1"
}
```

### Meta-arguments defined by Terraform
Terraform has some defined meta-arguments defined which are available for all provider blocks. They are:
1) **version**: Constraining the allowed provider versions
2) **alias**: Using the same provider with different configurations for different resources. More on this below.

### The *alias* argument
To create multiple configurations for a given provider, we use the alia smeta-argument to provide an extra name segment. 

```
# The default provider configuration, referenced as _aws_
provider "aws" {
    region = "us-east-1"
}

# The additional provider configuration, reference as _aws.west_
provider "aws" {
    alias = "west"
    region = "us-west-2"
}
```
