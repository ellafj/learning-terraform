# Using the Terraform CLI (Outside of Core Workflow)

## `terraform fmt`
The `terraform fmt` command is used to rewrite Terraform configuration files to a canonical format and style. It will output the filenames of any files it modified.

### How to use
The command usage is 

```
terraform fmt [options] [DIR]
```

Furthermore, when formatting configuration files, we use the flag `-diff` as such

```
terraform fmt -diff
```
to see the differences. If we wish to process the subdirectories as well we use

```
terraform fmt -recursive
```
Lastly, if we wish to configure files in many directories but do not want to see the list of file chnges, we should use

```
terraform fmt -list=false
```


### When to use
It is smart to proactively run `terraform fmt` on your modules after upgrading Terraform versions as the canonical format may change in minor ways. This is to ensure that all configurations follow the new versions. 

Note that `terraform fmt` only parses your HCL for interpolation errors or malformed resource definitions, which is why you should use `terraform validate` after formatting your configuration to check you configuration in the context of the provider's expectations.
