# Explain what IaC is

## What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?
Def: "The process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools."

Terraform for IaC provides:
1) Execution plans (describes the planned changes before implementing)
2) Resource graphs (depicts the allocation and overalllocation of each resource for each unit of time)
3) Change automation (Terraform determines what changes during updates and creates incremental execution plans that respect dependencies)

## The Infrastructure Lifecycle
We split the lifecycle into two parts: "Day 0" and "Day 1" activities.
