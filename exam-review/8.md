# Read, generate, and modify configuration

## Ways to assign variables in the configuration

1) Command-line flags, such as `terraform apply -var 'region=us-east-1'`.

2) From a file, such as `terraform.tfvars`. Then we can write `terraform apply -var-file="secret.tfvars"` This is beneficial if you f.eks want different variables for testing and for development.

3) From environment variables. Terraform will read environment variables in the form of `TF_VAR_name` to find the value for a variable. For example, the `TF_VAR_region` variable can be set in the shell to set the region variable in Terraform.

4) UI input. If you execute terraform apply with any variable unspecified, Terraform will ask you to input the values interactively. The values are not saved and is not recommended for everyday use.

NB! Environment variables do not support `list` and `map` types, only `string`-type variables. 

## Data-types for variables
1) String, 2) numbers, or 3) bools. 

## Output-variables

```
output "ip" {
    value = aws_eip.ip.public_ip
}
```
is how you define an output. Multiple output blocks can be defined to specify multiple output variables. Outputs are shown when we run `terrform apply`, but you can aloso query the output of "ip" for example by the command `terraform output ip`.

## Resource spec
A resource spec addresses a specific resource in the config. It takes the form `resource_type.resource_name[resource index]`.
